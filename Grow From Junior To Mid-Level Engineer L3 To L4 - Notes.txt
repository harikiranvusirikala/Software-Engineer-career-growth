Overview
How This Course Works
Here are the core parts of the lesson:
• You'll understand what it means to be a junior vs. a mid-level engineer in the market, including the interview space
• We walk you through the course objectives. By the end of the course, you will understand:
	• 💡 Truly understand the difference between a junior engineer and a mid-level engineer
	• 🛠️ Learn to code like a mid-level engineer
	• 💪 Know what it means to be truly independent
	• 🧠 Have the right mindset to act as a mid-level
	• ✅ Define a clear roadmap to mid-level


At A Glance: Junior Vs. Mid-Level
What exactly does it mean to be a junior engineer vs. a mid-level engineer? What's the gap? This lesson teaches you:
• What it means at a high-level to be a junior vs. a mid-level engineer
• The difference in execution between a junior engineer and a mid-level engineer
• The types of tasks junior engineers work on vs. a mid-level engineer
• The ownership and scope difference between a junior vs. a mid-level engineer
• The difference in organizational complexity between junior engineers and mid-level engineers


It's On You
For later promotions (i.e. senior and beyond) there are many other factors at play besides your personal skill and growth. This isn't the case for junior engineer -> mid-level engineer. This lesson teaches you:
• The fundamental difference between the junior -> mid-level promotion and others when it comes to landing impact
• How to choose teams and projects as a junior engineer aiming to grow fast
• What matters when it comes to the junior -> mid-level promotion


Structuring Your Growth
Even though junior engineer to mid-level engineer is the 1st and easiest promotion, it's still a meaningful evolution with many parts. This lesson teaches you:
• The 3 core areas of improvement to grow from junior -> mid-level
• The most important area to improve to make the junior -> mid-level promotion
• How you should process the advice from this course



The Code
Decomposition
As a junior engineer, you will inevitably get a problem that's super scary which you have 0 idea how to solve. This will probably happen sooner rather than later. This lesson teaches you:

• The core tactic you need to master to solve large, incredibly complex problems
• Why decomposition is critical to being a good engineer
• The differences between junior and mid-level engineers when it comes to decomposition
• What it means to effectively decompose a problem, shown with an in-depth example


Code Quality
In order to survive as a junior engineer, you need to learn how to code fast. The next step is to learn how to code well. This lesson teaches you:
• The 2 core components behind code quality
• The differences between junior and mid-level engineers when it comes to their pull request quality
• The many ingredients behind a clean pull request and which ones matter the most
• What a clean pull request looks like, one showing strong mid-level engineer behavior
• The differences between junior and mid-level engineers when it comes to their technical decision making
• Why communication is so important when it comes to technical decisions and how mid-level engineers do it better than junior engineers
• How to understand seniority from fresh junior to strong mid-level through the lens of technical decision making
• A simple metric to measure your code quality and see if you're making good progress to mid-level


Code Review
As a mid-level engineer, it's not enough to write good code yourself - You need to help others write good code as well. This lesson teaches you:
• How junior and mid-level engineers differ when it comes to code review quantity, shown with concrete Meta numbers
• The difference between a junior engineer code review comment vs. a mid-level engineer code review comment, explained with an in-depth example


Debugging
When it comes to software, there will always be bugs. What many realizes don't realize is that your attitude towards bugs is a huge marker of your seniority. This lesson teaches you:
• Why junior engineers usually don't get assigned bugs
• The differences between junior engineers and mid-level engineers when it comes to bugs
• How to evaluate bug complexity overall
• What a mid-level engineer bug looks like vs. a junior engineer bug


Become A Go-To Person
One of the most obvious signs of engineer seniority is that everybody on their team goes to them for help with certain areas. More senior = more areas. This lesson teaches you:
• The easy way to understand the difference in mentality between junior and mid-level engineers when it comes to ownership
• How to become a go-to person for your area
• The one mantra you need to follow to organically deduce all the proper action items to become a go-to person
