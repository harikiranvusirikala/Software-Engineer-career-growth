Overview
How This Course Works
Here are the core parts of the lesson:
‚Ä¢ You'll understand what it means to be a mid-level engineer vs. a senior engineer in the market, including the interview space.
‚Ä¢ We walk you through the course objectives. By the end of the course, you will understand:
	‚Ä¢ üí° Truly understand the difference between a mid-level engineer and a senior engineer
	‚Ä¢ üß† Have the right mindset to behave as a senior engineer
	‚Ä¢ üõ†Ô∏è Identify your technical gaps to senior engineer
	‚Ä¢ üìÉ Figure out your fundamental gaps to senior engineer
	‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Define a clear roadmap to senior engineer


Why Is The Senior Promotion So Hard?
For most engineers, going from junior to mid-level isn't too hard with many of them achieving it unintentionally. This leads to them being surprised when the next promotion of mid-level to senior is so painfully difficult. This lesson teaches you:
‚Ä¢ The fundamental dynamic shift in skill development going from mid-level to senior
‚Ä¢ Why team selection is very important for growing to senior
‚Ä¢ The ambiguity of the senior promotion and the 2 broad paths you can take to get there
‚Ä¢ The large lagging nature of the senior promotion


At A Glance: Mid-Level Vs. Senior
What exactly does it mean to be a mid-level engineer vs. a senior engineer? What's the gap? This lesson teaches you:
‚Ä¢ What it means at a high-level to be a mid-level engineer vs. a senior engineer
‚Ä¢ The types of projects mid-level engineers work on vs. a senior engineer
‚Ä¢ The ownership and scope difference between a mid-level engineer vs. a senior engineer
‚Ä¢ The difference in organizational complexity between mid-level engineers and senior engineers


Structuring Your Growth
There are a lot of new skills you need to develop to go from mid-level engineer to senior engineer, far more than most people realize. So how does one process of all this? This lesson teaches you:
‚Ä¢ The 4 Meta engineering axes and what they mean (we'll be using these to organize the teachings from the course).
‚Ä¢ How to view the overall learning from this course
‚Ä¢ Why the senior promotion is different when it comes to these 4 engineering axes
‚Ä¢ The strategy you should follow to structure your growth journey, using this course's material as the basis


Finding The Right Team
Not every engineering team can support an additional senior engineer. This lesson teaches you:
‚Ä¢ What to look for in terms of product scope when choosing an engineering team to grow to senior
‚Ä¢ The people ingredients of a team that's good for senior promotion
‚Ä¢ Exactly what a great team for senior promotion looks like



Impact
The Goggles
Here's the harsh truth: The vast majority of mid-level engineers who are stuck at that level and unable to reach senior are holding themselves back (at least to some extent). This lesson teaches you:
‚Ä¢ The classic unhealthy mindset that mid-level engineers have that keeps them from ever reaching senior
‚Ä¢ How to correct the novice mid-level engineer mindset and evolve towards a senior engineer one by putting on The Goggles
‚Ä¢ How to think about The Goggles after you are aware of them (which you will be after going through this lesson)
‚Ä¢ The general way high-performing senior engineers (and beyond) view the world


Take Greater Ownership
As a senior engineer, you need to show strong ownership. Many mid-level engineers are told this by their manager but are unsure as to what that means. This lesson teaches you:
‚Ä¢ Why the "points" you get for impact aren't just correlated to the impact of the projects you work on
‚Ä¢ How to get more credit for each project you work on
‚Ä¢ What it means to show stronger, more holistic project ownership with a real-life example from Alex's past at Instagram


Fill In The Gaps
Senior engineers solve fundamentally different problems compared to mid-level engineers. This lesson teaches you:
‚Ä¢ The expectation for senior engineer mindset and behavior when problems arise in a project they're working on
‚Ä¢ The types of problems that mid-level engineers tend to avoid
‚Ä¢ The types of problems that senior engineers uniquely solve compared to more junior engineers
